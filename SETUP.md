# ClickView Setup Guide

## Quick Start with Aiven PostgreSQL

Your Aiven PostgreSQL database is already configured in the `.env` file. Follow these steps to get ClickView running:

### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd /Users/larry.cortez/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-InformationServicesGroup(ISG)/Documents/Projects/ClickView
```

### 2. Run the Automated Setup

```bash
./setup-database.sh
```

This script will:
- Install all dependencies (backend and frontend)
- Run database migrations on your Aiven PostgreSQL instance
- Set up the application for development

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000) servers.

### 4. Access ClickView

Open your browser and navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**

## Database Connection Details

Your Aiven PostgreSQL database is hosted at:
- **Host**: pg-1e0081a1-lcortez86-7b78.h.aivencloud.com
- **Port**: 12161
- **Database**: clickview
- **User**: avnadmin
- **SSL**: Required

The connection string is already configured in your `.env` file.

## First Steps in ClickView

1. **Create a Workspace**
   - Click "Add Workspace" 
   - Enter a name for your workspace
   - Add your ClickUp API key

2. **Get Your ClickUp API Key**
   - Log into ClickUp
   - Go to Settings â†’ Apps â†’ API Token
   - Generate or copy your personal token

3. **Create Your First Dashboard**
   - Select your workspace
   - Navigate to Dashboards
   - Click "Create Dashboard"
   - Start adding widgets!

## Manual Database Setup (if needed)

If you need to manually run migrations:

```bash
cd backend
npm run db:migrate
```

To verify the database connection:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# Check the console for "Database migration completed successfully!"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter connection errors:

1. Verify the `.env` file has the correct DATABASE_URL
2. Ensure your IP is whitelisted in Aiven (if IP restrictions are enabled)
3. Check that SSL is enabled (sslmode=require in the connection string)

### Port Already in Use

If ports 3000 or 3001 are already in use:

```bash
# Change frontend port in frontend/vite.config.ts
# Change backend port in .env file (PORT=3001)
```

### Dependencies Installation Failed

If npm install fails:

```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Try with legacy peer deps
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development servers
npm run dev

# Run only backend
npm run dev:backend

# Run only frontend  
npm run dev:frontend

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure PostgreSQL connection is working
4. Check that all dependencies are installed

## Next Steps

Once ClickView is running:
1. Connect your ClickUp workspace
2. Create dashboards with various widget types
3. Set up automated data refresh intervals
4. Share dashboards with your team
5. Customize filters and aggregations
